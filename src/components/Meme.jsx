{/*            <form className="form">      We change our <form> element into a <div> element because 
                                            when you have a <button>  inside of a form it actually submits that form and tends to refresh
                                            a page unless you stop it. But I realized that actually there is no reason for this to be collected 
                                            together in a form because ultimately this button does its own thing by getting a new image, 
                                            it is not take these inputs and submit them somewhere. So, in this case I feel like it's okay 
                                            to have our inputs floating outside of a form and that way i means that when we click our button,
                                            it doesn't refresh our page because it's not trying to submit a form.
